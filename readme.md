# Deep Dict

a simple cli app for Windows that provides translation service via LLM api

## Config & Run

- create a profile named  ``` ./key.dd.conf ``` then put it and the program together.

  ( I used OpenAI format api request in the program and thus, make sure your LLM api provider uses the same format. )

- to use the program, run in cli:  ``` deepdict.exe exampleword ```

  it is recommended to put the program into your PATH or set an alias for it.
